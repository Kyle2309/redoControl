# RedoControl

This package provides a few functions for making it easier to assign TRUE/FALSE to "redo variables", which can be used to determine whether to run a chunk of code provided to the `redo.if()` function or to read previous results from an RDS file.

## Installation

```
library(devtools)

install_github("kstagaman/redoControl")
```
